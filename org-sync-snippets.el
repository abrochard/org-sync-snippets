;;; Commentary:

;; Simple extension to export snippets to org-mode and vice versa.
;; It was designed with Yasnippet in mind.

;;; Install:

;; Install from MELPA with
;;
;; M-x package-install org-sync-snippets
;;
;; or load the present file.

;;; Usage:

;; Load with
;;
;; (require 'org-sync-snippets)
;;
;; To export your snippets to an org-mode file, use
;;
;; M-x org-sync-snippets-snippets-to-org
;;
;; Alternatively, to turn your org-mode file into snippets
;;
;; M-x org-sync-snippets-org-to-snippets
;;
;; Notice: you can prevent certain snippets from being exported to org by adding the `tangle: no` tag in them.

;;; Customize:

;; By default, snippets are taken from the 'user-emacs-directory' (typically '~/.emacs.d/snippets/') folder.
;; You can change this with
;;
;; (setq org-sync-snippets-snippets-dir "~/your/path/to/snippets")
;;
;; Similarly, the org file compiled goes to your 'org-directory' (usually '~/org/snippets.org').
;; You can define a different one with
;;
;; (setq org-sync-snippets-org-snippets-file "~/your/path/to/snippet/file")
;;
;; Finally, if you want to save your snippets regularly, I recommend using a hook like
;;
;; (add-hook 'yas-after-reload-hook 'snippets-to-org)

;;; Code:
(require 'org)
(require 'f)
